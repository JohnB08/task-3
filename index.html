            I dabble in writing in my free time. This short story got published
            in the english quarterly magazine; Makarelle. <br />

            I am an avid reader, allthough audiobooks are my primary modus
            operandus these days. <br />In the wast collection of fiction, as a
            reader you feel overwhelmed and defeated by the sheer amount of
            stories available. <br />
            So, as a philosophy I read as many one books by a single author as
            possible, <br />
            and selected a few that, as a goal, I would consume everything.
          </p>
          <h2>These are my current favourite authors:</h2>

                <h3>The Weird.</h3>
                <p>
                  Haruki Murakami is a very dificult author to like. His books
                  are often so bizzare it borders on the absurd. <br />Yet, when
                  he shines he truly shines. <br />
                  It is said when you read your first Murakami book; you either
                  fall in love, or you never read him again. <br />The first
                  book of his I read was "Kafka on the shore", a beautiful book
                  of lacking identity when growing up. <br />
                  I cannot recommend it enough, if you can handle the abstract
                  nature the story thrives in.

                <p>
                  Whenever you browse literary forums, they'll allways say the
                  same thing: <br />Stephen King is a bad writer. <br />
                  You can say he might lack the big lofty philosophical goals of
                  modern literature, <br />yet he has earned his nomenclature:
                  "The greatest storyteller alive" by simply writing excellent
                  stories. <br />Stories about horrible horrible stuff, yet
                  captivating and engaging. Oldschool fairytales for a modern
                  audience.
