            I am an avid reader, allthough audiobooks are my primary modus
            operandus these days. <br />In the wast collection of fiction, as a
            reader you feel overwhelmed and defeated by the sheer amount of
            stories available. <br />
            So, as a philosophy I read as many one books by a single author as
            possible, <br />
            and selected a few that, as a goal, I would consume everything.
          </p>

                <p>
                  Haruki Murakami is a very dificult author to like. His books
                  are often so bizzare it borders on the absurd. <br />Yet, when
                  he shines he truly shines. <br />
                  It is said when you read your first Murakami book; you either
                  fall in love, or you never read him again. <br />The first
                  book of his I read was "Kafka on the shore", a beautiful book
                  of lacking identity when growing up. <br />
                  I cannot recommend it enough, if you can handle the abstract
                  nature the story thrives in.

                  same thing: <br />Stephen King is a bad writer. <br />
                  You can say he might lack the big lofty philosophical goals of
                  modern literature, <br />yet he has earned his nomenclature:
                  "The greatest storyteller alive" by simply writing excellent
                  stories. <br />Stories about horrible horrible stuff, yet
                  captivating and engaging. Oldschool fairytales for a modern
                  audience.

                <p>
                  Douglas Adams created what might be the single best collection
                  of modern satire ever written with his "Hitchhiker" books.
                  <br />Yet he hated writing them, often being hounded by his
                  publisist and his agent to complete a new book. Which he did,
                  eventually, and in protest. <br />
                  "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" Is still one of the
                  greatest comedic works ever made, and the rest of the books
                  are almost as good.

                <p>
                  The story of Mikhail Bulgakov is a sad one. Forced into
                  medicine by his parents, later found solace in writing.
                  <br />A prolific writer of satire in the 20's,
                  <br />
                  yet in many ways it was writing that ended his life. In 1928
                  he started what would be his best, and last work. <br />
                  "The Master and Margarita" was supposed to be his ultimate
                  satire on life in the Soviet Union. <br />
                  Yet, just as the author-character in the book, Mikhail was
                  never satisfied. <br />
                  He died, book unfinished in 1940. <br />
                  In the end his wife completed the book, and it was released in
                  the 60s for everyone to read. <br />
                  The book apparently stressed him out, to the point of absolute
                  exhaustion, still it's a masterpiece in fiction.

            Music is the spice of life, so they say. It's hard to make a list of

              <h3>The All-rounder</h3>
              <p>
                Few artists these days can say they have full creative control.
                Yoann Lemoine, or Woodkid, has taken this a step further. <br />
                A graphics designer from France, he not only makes the music,
                but also directs most of the music videos and makes most of the
                imagery he uses on tour. <br />
                I might not like all his music, but have nothing but respect for
                the integrity in his work. <br />
                His music is slow rolling ballads with hard hitting percussion
                and strings, and while some can feel highly formulaic, others
                feel truly unique. <br />
                If I had to pick a favourite of his songs, it would be this:

              <p>
                The weird timing and playful nature of their basslines makes
                this band a joy. <br />
                With funky rythms and excellent storytelling. <br />
                Allthough mostly an instrumental band, I don't need to know
                mandarin to get the story of each melody. <br />
                From the joyful "Underwater" to the horrifying "Happy, but sad",
                the way they use their music to tell stories are bar none.
                <br />
                My favourite song of theirs at the moment is probably:

                They contantly play with timing and speed, allways surprising,
                and all their songs can turn on a dime. <br />
                Their playfullness is equal to their mastery of the craft; every
                song a complete composition. And allthough they might not be
                storytellers like Elephant Gym, <br />
                their music none the less takes you on an emotional journey. My
                favourite song is: <br /><iframe

                The anger which Franck Hueso can summon from his synth is
                nothing short of extraordinary. <br />Musically he fits in more
                with the old-school metal music form the 80's and early 90's,
                <br />
                yet through his use of synth he can conjure up new auditory
                imagery the metal bands of yore could only dream of. <br />

                <br />There is something brutal and pure about their songs, a
                weird beauty that can't easily be described, <br />
                other than it hits a more primal part of me. <br />
                It engages me on a different level than most all other music.
